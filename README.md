üìã Leave Management System (SPFx Web Part)
A modern, integrated solution for leave requests, approvals, and tracking built with SharePoint Framework, React, Redux, and Power Automate.

üöÄ Project Overview
As a SharePoint Support Specialist, I developed this SPFx web part to streamline leave management processes in organizations. This solution replaces manual email/spreadsheet tracking with an automated, user-friendly system integrated directly into SharePoint.

Key Workflow:

Users submit leave requests via a React-based form.
Data is stored in a SharePoint list with a "Pending" status.
Power Automate triggers approval workflows:
First-level approver notified via email.
If approved, escalates to next approver.
If rejected, initiator receives notification.
Dashboard displays real-time leave stats (pending/approved/rejected).
History page allows filtering by leave type/status.
